# Fishing_Leaderboard
Custom leaderboard to compete at fishing
# The Reason Behind It
This project came to my mind when I was a sophomore in high school just learning to code, and I wanted to make a program/app to be able to store scores and compete with my family members when we go to our summer vacation spot on the Saint Lawrence River. After years of coding I was finally able to do it. Make a simple leaderboard that would locally store scores and show who the top three contenders are in real time.
